  improved core shared by other DarkArts Studios Editor Extensions
* Sound Generator Composition Inspector now has a button to open Composition
  Editor
* Removed some legacy debug logging that should never have been released
* Fixed audio clip discarding console warning when using "Smooth Loop" within
  an Output Module
* Began upgrading entire UI with improved icons more accurately depicting

v2.0.1
-------

This change was motivated by feedback after the Asset Store February Madness
sale at the beginning of February 2014.

* Harmonics Module added
* Output Module now has a "Loop"ù playback button playing back the composition
  as a loop
* Output Module has a "Smooth Loop" option, smoothing out looping sounds if
  checked.
* Fixed an issue with very high resolution Mac platforms where modules became
  uneditable (Related to a Unity Bug in which control-ids of Slider controls
  have issues). Disabled all Slider controls within modules until Unity
  resolves this.

First public release of Sound Generator as a complete rewrite in modular form
